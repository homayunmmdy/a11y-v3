## ðŸŽ¯ About the Course

This course is a practical guide to building accessible web applications that work for everyone. It focuses on:

* Using semantic HTML and alt text for screen reader compatibility
* Creating accessible navigation through focus management, tab order, and keyboard traps
* Fixing color contrast issues for visually impaired users
* Making advanced UIs accessible using ARIA roles and labels

The course also offers real-world demos and debugging techniques, empowering developers to become accessibility champions in their teams.

## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

This repository contains my personal notes and code implementations based on the *Website Accessibility, v3* course on Frontend Masters. It includes:

* Clear summaries of each lesson
* Hands-on examples and accessibility patterns
* Comparisons between *v2* and *v3* content
* Insights on whatâ€™s changed and what remains essential

You can also find my earlier attempt at version 2 of the course here:

## ðŸ”„ Why I Took This Course (Again)

I first took *Website Accessibility, v2* on **March 15, 2025**, but didnâ€™t take detailed notes at the time. With version 3 released, I wanted to revisit the material, identify new content, and reinforce key concepts.

Interestingly, some practices that were considered *optional* back then are now *mandatory* in modern development. Accessibility has become a crucial standard, and I wanted to ensure I fully understood how to implement it across all my projects.



## ðŸ“¢ Note on Course Access

Due to international sanctions in Iran, I was unable to access the official Frontend Masters platform directly. I completed the course through a third-party source and followed it thoroughly. Although I do not have an official certificate, this repository documents all lessons learned and code completed, ensuring transparency in my learning process.
