## What is accessibility ?

When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use. Making the web accessible benefits individuals , businesses, and society.

## Screen Readers

### How do they work ?

Screen readers convert digital text into synthesized speech. They empower users to hear Content
and navigate with the keyboard. The technologies helps people who are blind or who have low vision to use
information technology with the same level of independence and privacy as anyone else.

### Alternative text

By default, when a screen reader encounters an image , if it can't find alt text it will read aloud the file's name.
This gets especially tricky for user generated images which often get hashed files names.

### Alt text

Adding an alt attribute will override that behavior. Screen readers will read the Alternative
text instead of the file name.

### Skipping over images

Sometimes your website will have image that are strictly for decorative purposes. In that case , an empty alt attribute will force the screen reader to skip over the image.

### A note one SEO

Search engines also make use of alternative text, For years SEO shops have suggested stuffing the keywords you want to rank for into alt text
whenever possible. This provides a very bad accessibility experience.

### Caption for audio

Remember note all content on the web is visual! if your application has video content, be sure to use a captioning service to add closed captioning.

## Semantic HTML

### Element have semantic meaning but no special functionality

- aside
- footer
- header

### Elements provide a lot of build-in functionality

- button
- input
- textarea

### Form Labels

Form fields can be confusing for screen reader users. There are many ways to
label form fields so the label is read out loud whenever the field has focus.

### Anti pattern - Visual only Labels

A common pattern is using div's or paragraph tags to label form fields.

```html
<form>
  <p>First Name</p>
  <input type="text" />
  <p>Last Name</p>
  <input type="text" />
  <p>Password</p>
  <input type="password" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

### HTML Labels

A better option is to use the HTML label tag which will allow screen readers to recite the label when the filed is focused.

```html
<form>
  <label for="first">First Name</label>
  <input id="first" type="text" />

  <label for="last">Last Name</label>
  <input id="last" type="text" />

  <label for="password">Password</label>
  <input id="password" type="password" />

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

### Implicit HTML Labels

Another cool trick you can do is wrap your inputs with the label tag. This is called implicit labelling.

```html
<form>
  <label>
    First Name
    <input id="first" type="text" />
  </label>

  <label for="last">
    Last Name
    <input id="last" type="text" />
  </label>

  <label for="password">
    Password
    <input id="password" type="password" />
  </label>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

### Limitations with the label tag

The label tag can only work with label able elements.

- button
- input
- keygen
- meter
- output
- progress
- select
- textarea

### aria-label

if you ever need to label an elements not on that list. use aria-label instead.

```html
<div aria-label="Interactive div">Hello</div>
```

## Divs are not buttons

here is the button with the div

```html
<div onclick="alert('hello')">Click me!</div>
```

tell screen reader it's clickable

```html
<div role="button" onclick="alert('hello')">Click me!</div>
```

allow users to tab to it

```html
<div tabindex="0" role="button" onclick="alert('hello')">Click me!</div>
```

allow keyboard users to interact with it!

```html
<div
  tabindex="0"
  role="button"
  onclick="alert('hello')"
  onKeyup="alert('hello')"
>
  Click me!
</div>
```

tell screen readers what it does!

```html
<div
  aria-label="Alert the word hello"
  tabindex="0"
  role="button"
  onclick="alert('hello')"
  onKeyup="alert('hello')"
>
  Click me!
</div>
```
Or,just use a button
```html
<button onclick="alert('hello')">Click me!</button>
```
