## Screen Readers

### How do they work ?

Screen readers convert digital text into synthesized speech. They empower users to hear Content
and navigate with the keyboard. The technologies helps people who are blind or who have low vision to use
information technology with the same level of independence and privacy as anyone else.

### Alternative text

By default, when a screen reader encounters an image , if it can't find alt text it will read aloud the file's name.
This gets especially tricky for user generated images which often get hashed files names.

### Alt text

Adding an alt attribute will override that behavior. Screen readers will read the Alternative
text instead of the file name.

### Skipping over images

Sometimes your website will have image that are strictly for decorative purposes. In that case , an empty alt attribute will force the screen reader to skip over the image.

### A note one SEO

Search engines also make use of alternative text, For years SEO shops have suggested stuffing the keywords you want to rank for into alt text 
whenever possible. This provides a very bad accessibility experience.

### Caption for audio
Remember note all content on the web is visual! if your application has video content, be sure to use a captioning service to add closed captioning.
